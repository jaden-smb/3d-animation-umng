## stretch-and-squash-ball-axis-bounding 

This Python script is used to create a bouncing ball animation in Maya, a 3D computer graphics application. The script uses Maya's command language (Maya commands or maya.cmds) to create and manipulate 3D objects and their animations.

Here's a breakdown of the functions:

create_ball_and_rig(): This function creates a sphere (the ball) and a group (the rig) that will be used to control the ball. The ball is parented to the rig, and the rig's pivot point is set to the center of the ball.

apply_squash_deformer(rig): This function applies a 'squash' deformer to the rig. This deformer will be used to squash and stretch the ball during the animation.

set_initial_position(rig): This function sets the initial position of the rig (and therefore the ball) in the scene.

move_squash_pivot(squash, ball_center): This function moves the pivot point of the squash deformer to the bottom of the ball.

set_falling_and_bouncing_keyframes(rig, squash, bounce_times, bounce_heights, squash_factors): This function sets keyframes for the rig's Y position and the squash deformer's factor to simulate the ball falling and bouncing. The ball's Y position and squash factor are animated over time according to the provided bounce times, bounce heights, and squash factors.

set_forward_movement_keyframes(rig): This function sets keyframes for the rig's X position to simulate the ball moving forward during the animation.

set_rotation_keyframes(rig, bounce_times, rotation_amount): This function sets keyframes for the rig's rotation to simulate the ball rotating during the falling and in-air phases of the animation.

set_continued_movement_and_rotation_keyframes(rig, bounce_times, rotation_amount): This function sets keyframes for the rig to continue moving and rotating after the last bounce.

The main() function combines all these steps to create the full animation. It first defines some parameters for the animation (bounce times, bounce heights, squash factors, and rotation amount), then it creates the ball and rig, applies the squash deformer, sets the initial position, moves the squash pivot, and sets the keyframes for the falling and bouncing, forward movement, rotation, and continued movement and rotation.
