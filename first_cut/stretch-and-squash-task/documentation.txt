## stretch-and-squash-ball

This Python script is used to animate a bouncing ball in Maya, a 3D computer graphics application. The animation includes the "stretch and squash" principle, which is a common technique in animation to give more life and flexibility to animated objects.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

It imports the maya.cmds module, which is a Python interface to Maya commands.

It sets the initial and end positions of the ball (start_pos and end_pos).

It creates a sphere (ball) using the polySphere command.

It sets the total frames for the animation (total_frames) and extra frames for the exaggeration phase (extra_frames).

It then enters a loop for each frame of the animation.

For each frame, it calculates the current position of the ball. If the current time is less than the total frames, it calculates the position based on a quadratic easing function. Otherwise, the position is set to the end position.

It sets a keyframe for the ball's position at the current frame using the setKeyframe command.

It calculates the "squash and stretch" of the ball. If the ball is in the air (position > end position + 1), it stretches the ball along the Y axis and shrinks it along the X and Z axes. If the ball is on the ground, it squashes the ball along the X axis and stretches it along the Y axis. The amount of squash and stretch gradually changes over time.

After the loop, it sets the final keyframes for the ball's scale to return it to its original shape.

This script creates a bouncing ball animation where the ball stretches as it rises and squashes as it hits the ground, giving the animation a more dynamic and realistic feel.

This Python script is used to animate a bouncing ball in Maya, a 3D computer graphics application. The animation includes the "stretch and squash" principle, which is a common technique in animation to give more life and flexibility to animated objects.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

It imports the maya.cmds module, which is a Python interface to Maya commands.

It creates a sphere (ball) using the polySphere command and sets its initial position higher up.

It sets keyframes for the ball's Y position to simulate falling and bouncing. The ball will fall to the ground over the course of 1 second (24 frames at 24 fps), then it will bounce 4 times over the next 9 seconds (216 frames). The times and heights of the bounces are stored in bounce_times and bounce_heights.

It sets keyframes for the start and end of the fall. Then, for each bounce, it sets a keyframe for when the ball hits the ground and a keyframe for the peak of the bounce.

It sets keyframes for the ball's X position to simulate forward motion. The ball will move steadily in the X direction over the course of the animation.

It sets keyframes for the ball's scale to simulate squash and stretch. The ball will squash when it hits the ground and stretch in the air. The amount of squash and stretch gradually changes over time.

After the loop, it sets the final keyframes for the ball's scale to return it to its original shape.

This script creates a bouncing ball animation where the ball stretches as it rises and squashes as it hits the ground, giving the animation a more dynamic and realistic feel.
