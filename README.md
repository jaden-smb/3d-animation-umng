# 3D Animation and Dynamics - Universidad Militar Nueva Granada 
## By: Santiago Montoya Baiter

This repository is dedicated to the subject of 3D Animation and Dynamics at the Universidad Militar Nueva Granada. Here, you will find the tasks proposed during the course. These tasks include various codes and scripts related to 3D animation principles and techniques, such as the bouncing ball animation script previously discussed.

Each task will be added as it is proposed, and will include a detailed explanation of the code and the animation principles it demonstrates. This will serve as a valuable resource for understanding the practical application of 3D animation techniques in software like Maya.

Feel free to explore the tasks and use the code as a reference for your own 3D animation projects.
